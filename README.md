# Double Ratchet (TypeScript)

# This is a failed project: was meant to implement the Triple Ratchet with the scalar multiplication to prevent a two-compromise attack - but we post for the record to show we worked on something.

**Double Ratchet** is an implementation of the [Signal Double Ratchet Protocol](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) with **modern cryptographic primitives** following the official specification.

Authors:

Trevor Perrin & Moxie Marlinspike (original DoubleRatchet & X3DH white-paper)

[@peculiarventures](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures) for the `2key-ratchet` ([2key-ratchet on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/2key-ratchet)) | ([2key-ratchet on Github](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/2key-ratchet)) library/source code (under MIT license)

**Security Note:**

This implementation follows the standard Signal Double Ratchet specification. Academic research has identified a theoretical two-compromise attack vulnerability in the protocol, which is demonstrated in our CKA Attack demo.

## **Key Enhancements Over 2key-ratchet**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### **Signal Protocol**

- **Double Ratchet** - Standard Signal protocol implementation
- **Forward Secrecy** - Past messages remain secure after key compromise

## **What is the Double Ratchet?**

The **Double Ratchet** provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security through two ratcheting mechanisms:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Double Ratchet] --> B[DH Ratchet]
    A --> C[Symmetric Ratchet]

    B --> D["X25519 key exchange<br/>for each message round"]
    C --> E["HMAC-based key chains<br/>for message encryption"]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#fff3e0
```

### Security Properties

- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of current keys doesn't reveal past messages
- **Post-Compromise Security**: After compromise, new messages become secure again
- **Break-in Recovery**: Protocol heals itself from state compromise
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Works without requiring both parties online

### Vulnerability: Two-Compromise Attack

**Note**: The Double Ratchet has a known theoretical vulnerability where an adversary who compromises a party twice (before and after a DH step) can decrypt messages sent between those compromises. This is a minor limitation that affects security in very specific attack scenarios.

The CKA Attack demo shows this vulnerability in action.

### Security Disclaimer

> This implementation follows the Signal Double Ratchet specification and uses established cryptographic primitives. However, it has not undergone independent security audit. The implementation includes the known theoretical vulnerability to two-compromise attacks. Use in production environments should be preceded by appropriate security review.
